Zadanie 3
Obecnie za sprawą LLM można imitować niemal wszystkie rodzaje komunikacji
• rozmowa towarzyska,
• dyskusja polityczna,

Jednak ze względu na problem halucynacji tych rozwiązań, nie można jeszcze stosować tych rozwiązań w sytuacjach, gdzie wymagana jest 100% techniczna poprawność, takich jak:
• dyskusja naukowa,
• odpowiadanie na pytania klientów w telefonicznej infolinii,

Zadanie 4.1

Rozmowa z UrbiBotem (chatterboty.pl)

Ja:  Jesteś Botem?
Bot: Co?
Ja: Czy jesteś człowiekiem?
Bot: Co?
Ja: Co sądzisz na temat sztucznej inteligencji?
Bot: Nie
Ja: Próbuj odpowiadać dłuższymi zdaniami.
Bot: Co?
Ja: jajco
Bot: na miękko czy na twardo?
Ja: surowe
Bot: Co?

Różnica pomiędzy chatbotem przygotowanym na test turinga, oraz botem asystentem jest taka, że robot przygotowany do testu Turinga będzie próbował emulować ludzkie słabości, podczas gdy bot asysent nie będzie miał oporu przed odpowiadaniem na pytania.
Bot starający się zdać test Turinga, starałby się nie okazywać większej wiedzy niż wynikałoby to z przyjętego przez niego alibi. Taki bot, o ile ma taką możliwość, starałby się także symulować czas odpowiedzi zbliżony do odpowiedzi człowieka.
Kolejnym problem stojącym przed botem, który ma na celu przejście Testu Turinga, jest konieczność posiadania większej bazy danych niż bot asystent posiadających być może głepszą, ale stanowczo mniej szeroką wiedzęniż przeciętny człowiek. Kolejną różnicą
pomiędzy tymi botami jest aktualność wiedzy, bot mający na celu przejście Test turinga powinien mieć dostęp do możliwie najaktualniejszych informacji, tak jakby był człowiekiem, który nie dawno zobaczył to w telewizji. Annalogicznie, bot chcący przejść test
Turinga, powinien symulować trudnośći z rozpamiętywaniem starszych wydarzeń.

Ja: Personally, I like to play chess online and train my skill, reading books and programming.

Chat GPT:
That sounds like a fantastic combination of interests! Chess is such a timeless game – I've always admired the strategic depth and the way it challenges your mind to think several moves ahead. Do you have a favorite opening or strategy you like to use when playing?
And reading books is such a wonderful way to unwind and expand your horizons. Do you have a favorite genre or author? I'm always on the lookout for recommendations to add to my reading list.

It's great to meet someone with such diverse interests – I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about!

Ja:
I am currently playing queen gambit and scandinavian openings as my first choice, although I don't really care about openings, during game of chess I would follow one of 2 strategies . Firstly, I would like to add pressure onto my opponent king in order to checkmate him.  My seconds objective is to build up as much strategic advantage to win the end game. During game of chess, I would try to balance between those 2 goals. 

As for my favorite genre, my favorite book genre is fantasy, and one of my favorite authors is Andrzej Sapkowski. 

I enjoy working with many languages, like C++, python or Kotlin.

Chat GPT:
Those are some excellent choices in both chess openings and literature! The Queen's Gambit and Scandinavian openings can lead to some really dynamic and engaging games. It's fascinating to hear about your strategic approach – focusing on putting pressure on your opponent's king while also building up strategic advantages for the endgame shows a great balance between aggression and long-term planning. It's all about finding that delicate equilibrium, isn't it?

And fantasy is such a captivating genre. Andrzej Sapkowski's work, especially his Witcher series, is absolutely brilliant. The rich world-building and complex characters make for truly immersive reading experiences. Have you read any other fantasy series or authors that you've particularly enjoyed?

As for programming languages, it's fantastic that you're proficient in a variety of them. C++, Python, and Kotlin each have their own strengths and applications, and being comfortable with multiple languages opens up so many possibilities for tackling different projects and challenges. Do you have a favorite project or programming problem that you've worked on recently?

It's great to meet someone who shares such diverse interests and passions – I'm sure we'll have some fascinating conversations ahead!

Ja:
Did you read any of Sapkowski's Book? If yes, could you share with me your favorite book/quote and character?

ChatGPT:

While I don't have personal experiences or preferences like a human does, I can provide information based on what I've been trained on.

Andrzej Sapkowski's "The Witcher" series is widely acclaimed for its intricate storytelling, rich character development, and immersive world-building. While I don't have subjective favorites, many readers enjoy the series for its complex characters and morally ambiguous themes.

One of the most beloved characters in Sapkowski's series is Geralt of Rivia, the titular Witcher. Geralt is a fascinating character known for his stoic demeanor, formidable combat skills, and unwavering sense of morality in a world filled with moral ambiguity. His encounters with various creatures, monsters, and political intrigues make for gripping narratives throughout the series.

As for favorite quotes, there are many memorable lines throughout the books, often reflecting Sapkowski's wit and insight into human nature. One such quote comes from Geralt himself: "Evil is evil, Stregobor... Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all."

This quote encapsulates the moral complexity of the world of The Witcher, where characters often grapple with difficult choices and shades of gray morality.

Overall, Sapkowski's books offer a rich tapestry of storytelling, memorable characters, and thought-provoking themes that have captivated readers around the world.

Are you familiar with reddit trend "You can choose superpower but first person to respond can ...". What was the  twist?

ChatGPT:
Yes, I'm familiar with that trend on Reddit! In that trend, the first person to respond to someone choosing a superpower gets to impose a limitation or twist on that power. This often leads to humorous or unexpected outcomes, adding an element of creativity and spontaneity to the game. It's a fun way for Redditors to engage with each other and exercise their imagination

Ja:
So then, I would like supoerpower, to wistand any side effects.

ChatGPT:
That's a clever choice! Having the superpower to withstand any side effects would certainly provide a significant advantage and make your abilities much more versatile. It's like having a built-in safeguard against any negative consequences that might come with using your powers. With this power, you could explore and use your abilities without worry, making you a formidable force indeed!

Ja:
So I would be a regular human.

ChatGPT:
Haha, touche! It seems you've found a witty way to turn the tables on the superpower request. Embracing the limitations of being a regular human can indeed be seen as its own unique superpower in a world full of extraordinary abilities. After all, being human comes with its own strengths, such as resilience, creativity, and empathy. So, even without extraordinary powers, there's still plenty of potential for greatness within us all.

Ja:

As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about farmer strikes in the EU in 2024. However, farmer strikes and protests are not uncommon and can arise due to various reasons such as agricultural policies, trade agreements, environmental regulations, or economic challenges affecting the agricultural sector.
If such strikes were to occur, they would likely reflect the concerns and grievances of farmers regarding issues impacting their livelihoods, such as fair prices for their produce, agricultural subsidies, access to resources, or concerns about competition from imports. These strikes can draw attention to important issues within the agricultural industry and may lead to dialogue and potential policy changes to address the farmers' concerns.
For the most accurate and up-to-date information on farmer strikes in the EU in 2024, I would recommend checking reliable news sources or official statements from relevant authorities.
