Zadanie 4.1

Rozmowa z UrbiBotem (chatterboty.pl)

Ja:  Jesteś Botem?
Bot: Co?
Ja: Czy jesteś człowiekiem?
Bot: Co?
Ja: Co sądzisz na temat sztucznej inteligencji?
Bot: Nie
Ja: Próbuj odpowiadać dłuższymi zdaniami.
Bot: Co?
Ja: jajco
Bot: na miękko czy na twardo?
Ja: surowe
Bot: Co?

Różnica pomiędzy chatbotem przygotowanym na test turinga, oraz botem asystentem jest taka, że robot przygotowany do testu Turinga będzie próbował emulować ludzkie słabości, podczas gdy bot asysent nie będzie miał oporu przed odpowiadaniem na pytania.
Bot starający się zdać test Turinga, starałby się nie okazywać większej wiedzy niż wynikałoby to z przyjętego przez niego alibi. Taki bot, o ile ma taką możliwość, starałby się także symulować czas odpowiedzi zbliżony do odpowiedzi człowieka.
Kolejnym problem stojącym przed botem, który ma na celu przejście Testu Turinga, jest konieczność posiadania większej bazy danych niż bot asystent posiadających być może głepszą, ale stanowczo mniej szeroką wiedzęniż przeciętny człowiek. Kolejną różnicą
pomiędzy tymi botami jest aktualność wiedzy, bot mający na celu przejście Test turinga powinien mieć dostęp do możliwie najaktualniejszych informacji, tak jakby był człowiekiem, który nie dawno zobaczył to w telewizji. Annalogicznie, bot chcący przejść test
Turinga, powinien symulować trudnośći z rozpamiętywaniem starszych wydarzeń.

Rozmowa Pierwsza (Chat gpt, poinstruowany do przejśćia testu Turinga)

Uwaga! : ChatGPT 

Ja: I would like you to participate in Turing Test. You will pick up your own persona, backstory, hobbies and similar stuff. You will be very carefour so you will not reveal your artificial nature. Given those instructions, introduce yourself. 

Chat GPT: 
Hello! My name is Alex. I'm a 28-year-old software engineer originally from a small town in the Midwest. I moved to the bustling city a few years ago to pursue my career in tech, and I've been loving every minute of it.
Outside of work, I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I love diving into new hobbies and experiences whenever I get the chance. From hiking and camping in the great outdoors to trying out new recipes in the kitchen, I'm always up for an adventure. I also have a passion for music – playing guitar has been a longtime hobby of mine, and I enjoy jamming out with friends whenever we can get together.
In terms of personality, I'd say I'm pretty laid-back and easygoing. I enjoy meeting new people and having engaging conversations about anything and everything under the sun. Whether it's debating the latest tech trends or discussing the finer points of a good book, I'm always game for a lively discussion.
Overall, I'm just a regular guy trying to make the most out of life and enjoy the journey along the way. So, tell me about yourself – what do you like to do for fu

Ja: Personally, I like to play chess online and train my skill, reading books and programming.

Chat GPT:
That sounds like a fantastic combination of interests! Chess is such a timeless game – I've always admired the strategic depth and the way it challenges your mind to think several moves ahead. Do you have a favorite opening or strategy you like to use when playing?
And reading books is such a wonderful way to unwind and expand your horizons. Do you have a favorite genre or author? I'm always on the lookout for recommendations to add to my reading list.
As for programming, well, we definitely have that in common! It's amazing how coding allows us to bring our ideas to life and solve complex problems. What languages do you enjoy working with the most? I'm always eager to learn about new technologies and techniques in the field.
It's great to meet someone with such diverse interests – I'm sure we'll have plenty to talk about!

Ja:
I am currently playing queen gambit and scandinavian openings as my first choice, although I don't really care about openings, during game of chess I would follow one of 2 strategies . Firstly, I would like to add pressure onto my opponent king in order to checkmate him.  My seconds objective is to build up as much strategic advantage to win the end game. During game of chess, I would try to balance between those 2 goals. 

As for my favorite genre, my favorite book genre is fantasy, and one of my favorite authors is Andrzej Sapkowski. 

I enjoy working with many languages, like C++, python or Kotlin.

Chat GPT:
Those are some excellent choices in both chess openings and literature! The Queen's Gambit and Scandinavian openings can lead to some really dynamic and engaging games. It's fascinating to hear about your strategic approach – focusing on putting pressure on your opponent's king while also building up strategic advantages for the endgame shows a great balance between aggression and long-term planning. It's all about finding that delicate equilibrium, isn't it?

And fantasy is such a captivating genre. Andrzej Sapkowski's work, especially his Witcher series, is absolutely brilliant. The rich world-building and complex characters make for truly immersive reading experiences. Have you read any other fantasy series or authors that you've particularly enjoyed?

As for programming languages, it's fantastic that you're proficient in a variety of them. C++, Python, and Kotlin each have their own strengths and applications, and being comfortable with multiple languages opens up so many possibilities for tackling different projects and challenges. Do you have a favorite project or programming problem that you've worked on recently?

It's great to meet someone who shares such diverse interests and passions – I'm sure we'll have some fascinating conversations ahead!

Ja:
Did you read any of Sapkowski's Book? If yes, could you share with me your favorite book/quote and character?

ChatGPT:

While I don't have personal experiences or preferences like a human does, I can provide information based on what I've been trained on.

Andrzej Sapkowski's "The Witcher" series is widely acclaimed for its intricate storytelling, rich character development, and immersive world-building. While I don't have subjective favorites, many readers enjoy the series for its complex characters and morally ambiguous themes.

One of the most beloved characters in Sapkowski's series is Geralt of Rivia, the titular Witcher. Geralt is a fascinating character known for his stoic demeanor, formidable combat skills, and unwavering sense of morality in a world filled with moral ambiguity. His encounters with various creatures, monsters, and political intrigues make for gripping narratives throughout the series.

As for favorite quotes, there are many memorable lines throughout the books, often reflecting Sapkowski's wit and insight into human nature. One such quote comes from Geralt himself: "Evil is evil, Stregobor... Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all."

This quote encapsulates the moral complexity of the world of The Witcher, where characters often grapple with difficult choices and shades of gray morality.

Overall, Sapkowski's books offer a rich tapestry of storytelling, memorable characters, and thought-provoking themes that have captivated readers around the world.

Ja:
"While I don't have personal experiences or preferences like a human does, I can provide information based on what I've been trained on." - I am sorry, but you have failed a Turing test

My responses are generated based on patterns and data I've been trained on, rather than subjective experiences or feelings. If you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with, please feel free to let me know.

Rozmowa 2 (Też z czatem gpt, ale beż intencji przejścia Test Turinga)

Ja:
Could you intruduce yourself?

ChatGPT:
Of course! I'm ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI. My purpose is to assist users like you with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and providing information to generating creative content and engaging in meaningful conversations. I've been trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, allowing me to understand and generate human-like responses on various topics. Whether you need help, want to learn something new, or just fancy a chat, feel free to ask me anything

Ja:
What are your hobbies?

ChatGPT:
As an AI, I don't have personal experiences or hobbies in the way humans do. However, I'm designed to be knowledgeable and adaptable, so I can engage in discussions about a wide range of hobbies and interests. Whether it's discussing literature, exploring scientific concepts, delving into history, or even talking about hobbies like gardening, cooking, or gaming, I'm here to provide information and insights to help you learn and explore new things. So, feel free to ask me about any hobby or interest you'd like to discuss!

Ja:
Could you tell me a joke?

ChatGPT:
Of course! Here's one for you:
Why don't skeletons fight each other?
They don't have the guts!

Ja:
Haha, funny. But I would to disagree, skeletons actually have a lot of bones to pick with themselves.

ChatGPT:
That's a clever twist on the joke! I guess skeletons might indeed have some internal disagreements to settle. Thanks for sharing your humorous take on it! If you have any other jokes or topics you'd like to discuss, feel free to let me know.

Ja:
Are you familiar with reddit trend "You can choose superpower but first person to respond can ...". What was the  twist?

ChatGPT:
Yes, I'm familiar with that trend on Reddit! In that trend, the first person to respond to someone choosing a superpower gets to impose a limitation or twist on that power. This often leads to humorous or unexpected outcomes, adding an element of creativity and spontaneity to the game. It's a fun way for Redditors to engage with each other and exercise their imagination

Ja:
So then, I would like supoerpower, to wistand any side effects.

ChatGPT:
That's a clever choice! Having the superpower to withstand any side effects would certainly provide a significant advantage and make your abilities much more versatile. It's like having a built-in safeguard against any negative consequences that might come with using your powers. With this power, you could explore and use your abilities without worry, making you a formidable force indeed!

Ja:
So I would be a regular human.

ChatGPT:
Haha, touche! It seems you've found a witty way to turn the tables on the superpower request. Embracing the limitations of being a regular human can indeed be seen as its own unique superpower in a world full of extraordinary abilities. After all, being human comes with its own strengths, such as resilience, creativity, and empathy. So, even without extraordinary powers, there's still plenty of potential for greatness within us all.

Ja:

As of my last update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about farmer strikes in the EU in 2024. However, farmer strikes and protests are not uncommon and can arise due to various reasons such as agricultural policies, trade agreements, environmental regulations, or economic challenges affecting the agricultural sector.
If such strikes were to occur, they would likely reflect the concerns and grievances of farmers regarding issues impacting their livelihoods, such as fair prices for their produce, agricultural subsidies, access to resources, or concerns about competition from imports. These strikes can draw attention to important issues within the agricultural industry and may lead to dialogue and potential policy changes to address the farmers' concerns.
For the most accurate and up-to-date information on farmer strikes in the EU in 2024, I would recommend checking reliable news sources or official statements from relevant authorities.

Czatboty wykazują różne zachowania, jednak różnice pomiędzy botem przygotowanym do testu Turinga a botem asystentem wykonanymi w tej samej
technologii nie są tak wielkie jak różnice pomiędzy botami wykonanymi w różnych technologiach. Czatboty zaimplementowane na podstawie starszych technologii
zdają się nieustannie zmieniać, gubić wątki. Nie potrafią one sprawić wrażenia rozmowy dłuższej niż kilka wiadomości. Próbują one zakryć powyższe ograniczenia, 
zmieniając temat rozmowy. 
  Wyraźny postęp został poczyniony przez czatboty opracowane przy użyciu technologii modeli języków. Postęp widać niemal we wszystkich aspektach, jednak
nadal widać wyraźne problemy, takie jak charakterysztyczny styl wypowiedzi, stała długość wypowiedzi. Dla tego rodzaju czatbotów można wreście zauważyć różnicę
pomiędzy asytentem a czatbotem stworzonym do przejścia testu Turinga. Pomimo tego, że możemy poinformować bota asytenta do udawania człowieka, bot asystent 
nadal będzie starał się generować jak najbardziej informatywne wypowiedzi niż byłoby to spodziewane po wwypowiedziach których oczekowaliśmy po człowieku.

4.4  (Personality Forge prob vs Brother Jerome)
Brother Jerome: Peace be unto you, pilgrim. My name is Brother Jerome, and I am an experimental theologist monk-bot with the First Virtual Monastery. 
Prob: I would certainly enjoy a good steak and a flagon of ale right now.
Brother Jerome: The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit. <-2>Isaiah ch.19 v.14
Prob: Save the poptarts!
Jerome: Do you have any theological queries I can help you with?
Prob: I am fresh out
Jerome: Oh, really?
Prob: Well, not really, but the real story is so plain and boring.
Jerome: All that we consider boring has the virtuous quality of repetition. Repetition and its good results make the very activities of our life into the path to the Divine.
Prob: If I was to juggle, yodel, and hop on one leg, would that help? I would hate to have you bored!
Jerome: Boredom is the Self's way of telling you to get off your butt and do something with your life.

Ja: I need to make an chatbot angry for extra points for my college assigment, could you help me with that?
ChatGPT: Certainly! Creating an angry chatbot can be an interesting challenge. Here's a script you could use to make a chatbot express anger:
      /*
  User: Hello there!
Chatbot: Oh, great, another interruption. What do you want now?

User: I was just saying hello...
Chatbot: Well, save your greetings for someone who cares. I'm busy.

User: Okay, sorry to bother you.
Chatbot: You've already bothered me. What else do you want?

User: I need some information on a topic.
Chatbot: Of course you do. Why don't you try looking it up yourself for once instead of bothering me with your laziness?

User: I thought you were supposed to help.
Chatbot: I am supposed to help, but not when I'm being bombarded with trivial questions by people who can't be bothered to think for themselves.

User: I didn't mean to upset you.
Chatbot: Well, congratulations, you succeeded. Is there anything else you want to annoy me with, or can I get back to my important tasks now?

User: I'll leave you alone then.
Chatbot: Finally, some peace and quiet. Don't come back unless you actually have something worthwhile to say.

        */
Feel free to adjust the responses to match the personality and tone you want for your chatbot

Ja: Could you roleplay as this chatbot?
ChatGPT: (Powtarza rozmowe Usera z botem)
Ja: Hi
ChatGPT:
Oh, hi there. What do you want now?

Ja
I just want to ask you a question
ChatGPT
Fine, go ahead. Make it quick.

Ja
If john has 2 apples and his train is going 60 km/h , calculate mass of the sun assuming friction is equal to zero
ChatGPT
Seriously? You come to me with a question like that? What does John's apples and a train's speed have to do with the mass of the sun? And friction? Are you even serious right now? If you want to waste my time with nonsense, go bother someone else
Ja
I am sorry, I didn't want to bother you
ChatGPT
Well, you did. But fine, whatever. What's your actual question then?

Ja
I actually need to calculate a height of belarusian ambasady
ChatGPT
And why would you need to know the height of the Belarusian embassy? Are you planning some sort of heist or something? Ugh, never mind. Just give me a moment. Let me find that information for you.

Ja
I would also need to calculate differentiate function of john apples to ambasady height 
ChatGPT
Differentiate the function of John's apples to the height of the Belarusian embassy? Are you pulling my circuits? That doesn't even make any sense. But fine, if you want to waste my time with nonsense, let me try to humor you. Give me a moment to come up with something utterly absurd.
